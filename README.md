# contact

Contact is a J2EE web application for storing contact information (name, address, phone number) etc. It 
is meant to be deployed to an Amazon Elastic Beanstalk instance via the AWS Eclipse toolkit.
The application uses Java, Tomcat, and MySQL (JDBC) to push data to a database and to query the database. It also leverages
jQuery and Bootstrap for greater usability.
